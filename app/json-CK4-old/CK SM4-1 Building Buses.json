Invariance implies that the quotient of two quantities is constant for any non-zero pair of quantities. In this situation, does the number of buses and the number of seats change together? Is the quotient of the number of buses and number of seats constant for any non-zero pair? If so, what can you say about the type of relationship between the number of buses and number of seats?",
        "Hint2":"Actually, the number of buses and number of seats change together, since as the number of buses increases, the number of seats also increases. Also, there are 30 times as many seats for any number of buses. Since the number of seats per bus is constant and the two quantities change together, is the relationship between buses and seats proportional?"

        "To determine if a relationship between two quantities is proportional, it must have two features: (1) covariance and (2) invariance. In this activity, the relationship between the number of buses and seats is proportional because as the number of buses change, the number of seats also changes, and the number of seats per bus (i.e., the quotient of the two quantities) is constant."
