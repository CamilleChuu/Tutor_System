In this submodule, you worked on activities that highlighted using the key aspects of proportionality—covariance and invariance—to determine if a given relationship between two quantities is proportional. For a relationship between two quantities to be proportional, as one quantity changes, another quantity also changes. Also, the quotient of the two quantities is constant for any non-zero pairs of the two quantities.<br><br>As you reflect on the activities in this submodule, use the textbox to consider the following: (1) How would you describe the role of covariance and invariance to determine if a given situation is proportional? (2) How will you use this information in your teaching to support student understanding of ratios and proportional relationships?<br><br>Once you’ve finished your reflection, hit submit.",
