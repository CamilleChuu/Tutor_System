The graph represents the relationship between the number of sheets of paper and the height of the stack of paper in centimeters.\" <br><br> Previously, we determined that the relationship between the number of sheets of paper and the height of the stack of paper is proportional. To determine proportionality, the relationship between two quantities should have two features—covariance and invariance. When working through Submodule 4 (Proportionality), it is critical that you explain why a situation is or is not proportional based on whether the situation displays covariance and invariance. You can find definitions of these terms in the glossary. <br><br> Before working through the activities in Submodule 4 (Proportionality), let's look at ways to describe covariance and invariance using the Stacking Paper context.",

Additionally, we can see how the quotient of any non-zero pairs of the height of a stack of paper and the number of sheets of paper is constant, meaning the quotient of the two quantities is invariant.
