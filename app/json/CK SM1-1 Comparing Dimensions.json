We purposely selected these four rectangles to show not constant difference, but constant quotient will create similar rectangles. As the dimensions get larger (i.e., 37x40), the effect of the 3-unit difference is less on the ratio and it will look more like a square. However, as the dimensions get smaller (i.e., 7x10), the effect of the 3-unit difference is greater on the ratio and it will look less like a square. It's important to note here that because, the <i>quotient</i> of width and length (i.e., the ratio) and not the <i>difference</i> between the length and width determines how much a rectangle can look like a square."
