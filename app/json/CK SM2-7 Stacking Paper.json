You have already characterized the relationship between these two quantities. As the number of sheets increases, the height increases. Yet, their ratio (quotient) stays constant across different values. Think about how to use this information to generalize the relationship for any number of sheets (s) to find the corresponding height (h). Revise your answer based on this information and try again.",
                "Hint2": "The equation you construct should accurately represent the ordered pairs, ensuring that when you input any value for the number of sheets of paper (s), the equation yields the corresponding height (h) as shown on the graph. The constant of proportionality, which is the constant ratio between these two quantities, can be determined by dividing the height by the number of sheets. Consider the ordered pairs such as (20, 1), (40, 2), and (60, 3). Using this information, revise your equation accordingly and explain your reasoning."

            "By observing the graph, we can determine if the relationship between the height of the stack of paper and the number of sheets of paper is proportional by checking two things. First, they change together, meaning as the number of sheets increases, the height of the stack also increases. Second, the quotient of all ordered pairs is constant, which means the height of the paper stack is always 1/20 times as many as the number of sheets of paper. This demonstrates multiplicative invariance, confirming that the relationship is proportional. This information helps us write an equation representing this relationship in the form of y=kx, where k is the constant of proportionality, such that h=(1/20)s."
