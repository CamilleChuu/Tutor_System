        "Let's revisit the Stacking Paper activity you worked on previously: \"The local paper store is stacking identical sheets of paper and collecting data for packaging. The graph represents the relationship between the number of sheets of paper and the height of the stack of paper in centimeters.\"<br><br>Previously, we determined that the relationship between the number of sheets of paper and the height of the stack of paper is proportional. To determine proportionality, the relationship between two quantities should have two features—covariance and multiplicative invariance. When working through this submodule, it is critical that you explain why a situation is or is not proportional based on whether the situation displays covariance and multiplicative invariance. You can find definitions of these terms in the glossary.<br><br>Let’s practice how to analyze situations by focusing on covariance and multiplicative invariance.<br><br>First, let’s start with covariance! Covariance implies that two quantities change together, meaning as one quantity changes, another quantity also changes. <b>Based on the information in the graph, please describe whether covariance exists between the number of sheets of paper and the height of the stack of paper and explain your reasoning.</b>"

Multiplicative invariance implies that the quotient of two quantities is constant for any non-zero pair of covarying quantities that are measured in the same way. This means that regardless of the quantities involved, one quantity is always a fixed multiple of the other quantity, such as <i>y/x=k</i> or <i>y=kx</i> where <i>y</i> is <i>k</i> times as much as <i>x</i>.<br><br><b>Based on the graph, what can you say about multiplicative invariance?

      "To determine if the relationship between two quantities is proportional, it's important to identify if the two quantities covary and if their quotient is invariant. From the graph we can see how the two quantities covary because as the number of sheets of paper increases, the height of the stack of paper also increases, meaning the two quantities change together. Additionally, we can see how the quotient of any non-zero pairs of the height of the stack of paper and the number of sheets of paper is constant, meaning that the height of the paper stack is 1/20 times as many as the number of sheets of paper (i.e., multiplicatively invariant). Based on these two features, we can say that the relationship between the number of sheets of paper and the height of a stack of paper is proportional.<br><br>Also, before continuing with this submodule, remember that we use the terms \"proportional\" and “directly proportional” interchangeably.
