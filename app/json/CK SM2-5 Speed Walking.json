For instance, in this activity, the walking distance for John and Amy at 36 seconds can be determined by scaling (i.e., multiplying both terms of the ratio by the same number) or by employing the unit rate (i.e., 3/2 for John and 4/3 for Amy). Additionally, the steepness of each line on the graph is directly related to the unit rate, or constant of proportionality. Therefore, in this context, we can see that the steeper the line on a graph, the faster the person is walking, which means the greater the unit rate."
