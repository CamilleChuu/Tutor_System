        "Hint1": "Recall that for a relationship between two quantities to be proportional, they need to covary and their relationship to one another should be multiplicatively invariant. Covariance implies that they change together. Multiplicative invariance implies that their quotient is constant for any non-zero pair of quantities, meaning that that one quantity is always a constant multiple of the other quantity. In this situation, does the number of buses and the number of seats change together? Are there always 30 times as many seats as the number of buses? If so, what can you say about the type of relationship between the number of buses and number of seats?",
        "Hint2": "Actually, the number of buses and number of seats change together, since as the number of buses increases, the number of seats also increases. Also, there are 30 times as many seats for any number of buses. Since the number of seats per bus is constant and the two quantities change together, is the relationship between buses and seats proportional?"

      "To determine if a relationship between two quantities is proportional, it must have two features: (1) covariance and (2) multiplicative invariance. In this activity, the relationship between the number of buses and seats is proportional because as the number of buses change, the number of seats also changes. Also, there always 30 times as many seats as the number of buses, meaning the number of seats per bus (i.e., the quotient of the two quantities) is constant."
