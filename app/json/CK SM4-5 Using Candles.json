        "You have two candles, Candle A and Candle B, that are lit at the same time, and each is burning at a constant rate. When Candle A has burned 10mm in length, Candle B has burned 6mm in length. Is the relationship between the length that Candle A has burned to the length that Candle B has burned (or the decrease in the height of Candle A to the decrease in the height of Candle B as each candle is burning) proportional? Explain why or why not."

        "Hint1": "Recall that the problem is investigating the type of relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned. If the length that Candle A has burned doubles or triples, what happens to the length that Candle B has burned? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?",
        "Hint2": "Remember that when the length that Candle A has burned is 10mm, Candle B has also burned 6mm in length. If the length that Candle A has burned changes to 20mm, does the length that Candle B has burned also change? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?"

        "Expectation": "The length that Candle A has burned per the length that Candle B has burned is constant, indicating their relationship is multiplicatively invariant.",
        "Hint1": "We know that each candle is lit at the same time and is burning at a constant rate. Think about the length that Candle A has burned per the length that Candle B has burned. What can you say about the ratio of the length that Candle A has burned to the length that Candle B has burned, for any amount of time? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?",
        "Hint2": "Recall that when Candle A has burned 10mm in length, Candle B has also burned 6mm in length. Also, remember that the candles each burn at a constant rate and are lit at the same time. If the length that Candle A has burned doubles or triples, do you think that the length that Candle B has burned also doubles or triples? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?"

      "Expectation3": {
        "Expectation": "The relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned is proportional.",
        "Hint1": "Recall that for a relationship between two quantities to be proportional, they need to covary and their relationship to one another should be multiplicatively invariant. In this situation, what happens to the length that Candle B has burned if the length that Candle A has burned doubles? Also, is the quotient of the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned constant, meaning the burned length of Candle A is a constant multiple of the burned length of Candle B? Based on your answers to these two questions, what can you say about the type of relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned?",
        "Hint2": "Actually, since each candle was lit at the same time and each candle burns at a constant rate, as the length that Candle A has burned increases, so does the length that Candle B has burned. Also, the quotient of the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned is constant because the length that Candle A has burned is 5/3 times as much as the length Candle B has burned. Based on this information, is the relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned proportional?"

      "To determine if a relationship between quantities is proportional, it must have two features: (1) covariance and (2) multiplicative invariance. In this activity, we see how the relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned is proportional. Since the two candles are lit at the same time and each burns at a constant rate, we can infer that both candles will consistently burn off an amount of wax, and the length that Candle A has burned is always 5/3 times the length that Candle B has burned."
