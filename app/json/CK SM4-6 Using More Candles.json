        "John bought two identical candles, Candle A and Candle B. When he gets home, he lights Candle A. A few minutes later, John lights Candle B. Each candle is burning at a constant rate. John left for a few minutes and when he came back, he noticed that Candle A had burned a length of 16 mm and Candle B had burned a length of 10 mm. Is the relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned proportional? Explain why or why not."

      "Expectation1": {
        "Expectation": "As the length that Candle A has burned changes, the length that Candle B has burned also changes, meaning the two quantities covary.",
        "Hint1": "When the length that Candle A has burned doubles, does the length that Candle B has burned stay the same or change? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?",
        "Hint2": "Recall that John noticed when the length that Candle A has burned is 16 mm, the length that Candle B has burned is 10 mm. When the length that Candle A has burned increases, what happens to the length that Candle B has burned? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?"

      "Expectation2": {
        "Expectation": "The length that Candle A has burned per the length that Candle B has burned is not constant, indicating their relationship is not multiplicatively invariant.",
        "Hint1": "Recall that John lights Candle B a few minutes after he lights Candle A. Based on this information, what can you say about the ratio of the length that Candle A has burned to the length that Candle B has burned, at different time points? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?",
        "Hint2": [
          "Remember Candle B started burning after Candle A. This means that there is a time when Candle B has not started burning and Candle A had already started burning some of its length. Since the two candles are identical, they burn at the same rate. Using this information, you can find the length of burned candles other time points. For instance, when the length of burned Candle A is 24, the length of burned Candle B should be 18. Think about the relationship between the burned length of these candles for these two different time points by calculating their quotients.",
          "openPopupCalculator()",
          "You just calculated the quotients 16/10, 24/18, and so on. What do you notice about how many times the length of Candle A has burned as much as that of Candle B? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?"

      },
      "Expectation3": {
        "Expectation": "The relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned is not proportional.",
        "Hint1": "Recall the key aspects of proportionalityâ€”covariance and multiplicative invariance. In this situation, does the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned change together? Also, is the quotient of the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned constant? Based on your answer to these two questions, what can you say about the type of relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned?",
        "Hint2": "Actually, as the length that Candle A has burned changes, the length that Candle B has burned also changes. However, since the candles started burning at different times, the quotient of any non-zero pair of the two lengths is not constant, meaning the length that Candle A has burned is not a constant multiple of the length that Candle B has burned, at any time point. Based on this information, is the relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned proportional?"

      "To determine if a relationship between quantities is proportional, it must have two properties: (1) covariance and (2) multiplicative invariance. In this activity, we see how the relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned is not proportional. Even though the lengths that each candle has burned change together, since the candles are lit at different times, the length that Candle A has burned per the length that Candle B has burned is not constant."
