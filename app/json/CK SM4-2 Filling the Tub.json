      "Prompt": "Pica notices the faucet for her bathtub is leaking! She decides to place an empty bucket under the faucet to capture all the water. As the faucet leaks into the bucket, it is dripping intermittently. Pica leaves and comes back after 45 minutes. When she returns, Pica notices the amount of water in the bucket is 2 liters! Is the relationship between elapsed time and the amount of water in the bucket proportional? Explain why or why not.",
      "Expectation1": {
        "Expectation": "As time changes, the amount of water in the bucket also changes, meaning the two quantities covary.",
        "Hint1": "As elapsed time increases, consider how the amount of water in the bucket changes. What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?",
        "Hint2": "As elapsed time doubles or triples, does the amount of water in the bucket increase, decrease, or stay the same? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?"
      },
      "Expectation2": {
        "Expectation": "Since the water drops intermittently, the amount of water in the bucket per elapsed time is not constant, meaning their relationship is not multiplicatively invariant.",
        "Hint1": "The problem indicates that the water drops intermittently. Based on this information, what can you say about the amount of water in the bucket per elapsed time, at any time point? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?",
        "Hint2": "Recall that the problem indicates that the water drops intermittently. This means that the drops of water occur at irregular time points. What does this mean for the quotient of any non-zero pairs of elapsed time and the amount of water in the bucket? In other words, is the amount of water always a constant multiple of the elapsed time? What does this tell you about the key aspects of proportionality?"
      },
      "Expectation3": {
        "Expectation": "The relationship between elapsed time and water level is not proportional.",
        "Hint1": "Recall that for a relationship between two quantities to be proportional, they need to covary and their relationship to one another should be multiplicatively invariant. In this situation, does elapsed time and the amount of water in the bucket change together? Also, is the amount of water in the bucket a constant multiple of the elapsed time, meaning the quotient of any non-zero pairs of the two quantities is always the same? Based on your answer to these two questions, what can you say about the type of relationship between elapsed time and the amount of water in the bucket?",
        "Hint2": "Actually, elapsed time and amount of water in the bucket do covary, as the amount of water increases with time. However, the quotient of any non-zero pairs of the amount of water in the bucket and elapsed time is not constant, because the water drops into the bucket at irregular time intervals. Therefore, the relationship between the two quantities is not multiplicatively invariant. Based on this information, is the relationship between elapsed time and the amount of water in the bucket proportional?"

      "To determine if a relationship between two quantities is proportional, it must have two features: (1) covariance and (2) multiplicative invariance. In this activity, elapsed time and the amount of water in the bucket covary because the amount of water changes as time passes. However, the relationship between elapsed time and water level is not proportional because water drops intermittently, which causes the quotient of the amount of water in the bucket and elapsed time to not be constant (i.e., the amount of water in the bucket is not a constant multiple of the elapsed time)."
