Notice that the number of yellow and blue parts in the strip diagram represents the ratio of blue and yellow paint for each mixture. When comparing two different mixtures of the same two quantities, it is critical to focus on the multiplicative comparisons (e.g., the number of blue parts per the same number of yellow parts) instead of additive comparisons (e.g., there are two more blue parts than yellow parts)."
