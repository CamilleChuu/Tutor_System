time?"], ["Indeed, the amount of water in the bucket correlates with the elapsed time because the water volume increases over time. Nonetheless, the ratio between quantities of elapsed time and amount of water for any pairs that are non-zero does not remain consistent because the intervals at which water driplets enter the bucket are not regular. Thus, the relationship between these two variables does not maintain a consistent multiplicative nature. With this in consideration, can we say that elapsed time and the water volume present in the bucket have a proportional relationship?"], ["The amount of water in the bucket does indeed vary with the passage of time, as it increases as time goes on. Yet, the ratio between the amounts of water and the elapsed time is never consistent, owing to the fact that water falls into the bucket at irregular intervals. Thus, their relationship isn\u2019t constant when multiplied. Considering this, can we say the relationship between the time passed and the water volume in the bucket is proportional?"]]}}}}
