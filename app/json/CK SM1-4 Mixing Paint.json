Sarah begins her painting project by mixing 4 parts green paint with 3 parts red paint (Mixture A). After running out, she creates 5 parts green and 4 parts red for a larger batch (Mixture B). Still needing more, she makes an even larger batch with 6 parts green and 5 parts red (Mixture C).",

    "When working on problems like this, students often think that adding or subtracting the same amount to each quantity will produce the same results. This is because students often think keeping the difference between variable quantities constant will keep the relationship between the quantities the same. In contrast, as we see in this activity, the shade of gray is dependent on the amount of a quantity per one unit of the other quantity (i.e., green parts per one-part red). This means when the quotient of the two quantities is constant, the mixture will produce the same shade of gray. It's important for students to understand that some relationships depend on the constant quotient of the quantities to produce the same outcomes, rather than the constant difference between the quantities."
