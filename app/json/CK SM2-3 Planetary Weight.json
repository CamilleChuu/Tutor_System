The following two equations represent the weight of an object on Planet A and Planet B in relation to its weight on Mars.<br><br><ul><li>Planet A = 1/3 times the weight on Mars</li><li>Planet B = 1/4 times the weight on Mars</li></ul><br><br>Using the whiteboard, please draw a double number line to visualize the relationship. To give you an idea of how to create the double number line, we provide an example for the relationship between an object’s weight on Planet A compared to its weight on Mars. Using this information, construct a double number line to represent the relationship between Mars and Planet B. Draw two parallel number lines. On each line, create tick marks and label them with values by multiplying (or dividing) the values on each line by the same number, such as 2, 3, and 4.",

        "Double number lines can be used to visualize relationships between two quantities. In this problem, we used double number lines to show how all pairs of quantities vary directly with each other, and how the quotient of an object’s weight on Planet A to its weight on Planet B is constant, which is 4/3. Also, the quotient of an object’s weight on Planet B to its weight on Planet A is constant, which is 3/4. The unit rate, or constant of proportionality (i.e., k=y/x), is the quotient of two quantities and tells us how many units there are of the first quantity for 1 unit of the second quantity. We can use this information to write equations of the form y=kx, where k is the constant of proportionality."
