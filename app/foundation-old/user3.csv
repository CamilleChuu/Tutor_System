It's correct that you mentioned the rectangle with dimensions 37ft by 40ft should be most like a square. You recognized the concept that the square likeness is defined by how close the ratio of width to length is to 1.

It's correct that you mentioned how the 3-unit difference becomes less influential to the ratio value as the dimensions increase.
