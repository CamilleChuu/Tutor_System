It's correct that you noted the effect of increasing dimensions on the perception of a rectangle resembling a square, especially when the difference remains constant. You've adeptly connected the concept that as the dimensions increase, even with a consistent difference, the ratio approaches closer to 1, which makes it look more like a square. Furthermore, by understanding the impact of the ratio on the shape's resemblance to a square, you've effectively addressed the relationship between size and proportion in identifying squares amongst rectangles.

We purposely selected these four rectangles to show not constant difference, but constant quotient will create similar rectangles.

However, as the dimensions get smaller (i.e., 7x10), the effect of the 3-unit difference is greater on the ratio and it will look less like a square.
